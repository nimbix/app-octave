[GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical computations. 
It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing 
other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab. 
It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.
